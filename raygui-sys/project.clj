  ;; raygui at this revision calls raylib's TextToFloat, which raylib gained in
  ;; 5.5. raygui carries its own copy, but only behind RAYGUI_STANDALONE, which
  ;; this package does not define. So raylib-sys has to stay on raylib 5.5 or
  ;; newer, and against 5.0 that call is an undefined symbol.
